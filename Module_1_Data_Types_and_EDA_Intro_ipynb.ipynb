        "* Understand what \"data\" truly means in the context of EDA.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learn about different categories of data types and their significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Grasp the fundamental importance and purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",

        "### 1. What is Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Definition:** Raw facts, figures, or details that can be processed to produce information.\n",
        "* **Structured vs. Unstructured Data:**\n",
        " * **Structured:** Highly organized data that fits into a fixed field within a record or file. Examples: Databases (SQL), Excel spreadsheets, CSV files. Think rows and columns.\n",
        " * **Unstructured:** Data that does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Examples: Text documents, images, audio, video files, social media posts.\n",
        " * **Semi-structured:** A blend of both, having some organizational properties but not fully relational. Examples: XML, JSON files.\n",
        "* **Data Points/Observations/Records:** Each row in a structured dataset.\n",
        "* **Features/Attributes/Variables:** Each column in a structured dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Types of Data (in the context of statistical analysis):**\n",
        "\n",
        "This classification is critical because the type of data dictates which statistical methods and visualization techniques are appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **I. Numerical Data (Quantitative):** Represents measurable quantities.\n",
        "    * **A. Discrete:** Values are countable, often integers. They result from counting.\n",
        "        * *Examples:* Number of children in a family, count of defects, number of cars in a parking lot.\n",
        "    * **B. Continuous:** Values can take any value within a given range, often involving decimals. They result from measurement.\n",
        "        * *Examples:* Height, weight, temperature, time, price.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **II. Categorical Data (Qualitative):** Represents qualities or characteristics, often non-numerical.\n",
        "    * **A. Nominal:** Categories without any intrinsic order or ranking.\n",
        "        * *Examples:* Marital status (single, married, divorced), blood type (A, B, AB, O), color (red, blue, green). You can't say 'red' is \"greater\" than 'blue'.\n",
        "    * **B. Ordinal:** Categories with a clear order or ranking, but the intervals between ranks might not be equal.\n",
        "        * *Examples:* Education level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), customer satisfaction (poor, fair, good, excellent), movie ratings (1-star, 2-star...). You can say 'Master's' is \"higher\" than 'Bachelor's', but the \"difference\" between Bachelor's and Master's might not be the same as High School and Bachelor's.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **III. Datetime Data:** Represents points or periods in time. Often needs special handling for extracting features like year, month, day of week, etc.\n",
        "    * *Examples:* '2023-01-15', '10:30:00', '2023-07-16 11:41:10'."
